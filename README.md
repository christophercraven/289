Web 289 Final Project

This is a mobile app marketing site designed to help app developers find teamates, sponsors, and customers.

The plan is to allow customers to vote on their favorite apps to promote them in the app listings. Sponsors should be able to  place their logo on app pages and help fund new app development. Developers should be able to communicate with customers, sponsors, and other developers to build teams and market their apps.

Built with Phalcon PHP framework.
