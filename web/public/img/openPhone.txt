openPhone v1

After a long time without deviations, I am back with this release. I made some icons inspirated on the new iPhone, but I found out there are lots of similar works. So I thought my icons would be more useful if I released the source. And here we are. I hope they can be useful for you.

I made these icons on Illustrator and exported the layers to Photoshop (.PSD).

Enjoy!
